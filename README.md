## Configuration

TaskBunny uses passport.js with Google+ for sign-in

Follow these instructions to setup and app:

Create a project at https://console.developers.google.com
* Under APIs and auth
  * Credentials
    1. create a new client ID for a 'Web Application'
    2. you will have to provide a callback URL under Redirect URIs, make sure it is identical in your `google.json`
    3. for development http://localhost:8000/auth/google/callback/
    4. in production http://www.yourdomain.com/auth/google/callback/
  * APIs
    1. Under Social APIs enable the Google+ API. [(See passport-google-oauth Issue)](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-google-oauth/issues/72)

make a note of the client ID and Client secret.

On your development machine save them in a json file in the secrets folder at the root of the project
directory.

    secrets/google.json

It should look something like this:

```json
{
  "id": "226227493412-qv8bcmn987243mnoqhitu6sj3298msaz8g.apps.googleusercontent.com",
  "secret": "Ie_60237lfsln55ry9FAwZ-o",
  "url": "http://localhost:8000/auth/google/callback/"
}
```

## Deployment

When running the server in production make sure to set NODE_ENV environment variable to 'production'.

Your deployment script should run `grunt build` task. For Azure deployments this is handled by `deploy.sh` included in the project.


In production set the values of the following environment variables accordingly

    GOOGLE_APP_ID
    GOOGLE_APP_SECRET
    GOOGLE_APP_CALLBACK_URL

See the [server/config.js](server/config.js) for additional configuration environment variables to set.
